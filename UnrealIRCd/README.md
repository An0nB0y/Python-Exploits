Hello, Friend <3 :3
# What is that?
This is an exploit for UnrealIRCd. Which is an old vulnerability. And it have the exploit in rapid7 (metasploit). But, we have to stop being script kidz

#How did u do that?
I reverse engineer the protocole. And i noticed something strange, when u type AB; and type any command it get executed.

#On what u applied that?
Target: Metasploitable2 in docker
Host: Ubuntu 20.04

#Other...

Guys, we have to work more on our exploit-dev skills. When u do that u don't need to go to exploitdb or use metasploit or any other exploit framework.
Found the vuln, develop the exploit.
